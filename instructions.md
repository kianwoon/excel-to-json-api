# Step-by-Step Guide: Deploying a Secure FastAPI Service (Excel to JSON) using Render

This guide outlines the essential steps to develop and securely deploy a FastAPI application on Render that converts Excel files (XLS/XLSX) containing multiple sheets to JSON, incorporating API key authentication.

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Prepare Development Environment
- Install dependencies
- Set up Python environment

---

## 🛠 Step 2: Develop FastAPI Application
- Create a structured project directory
- Write main FastAPI application logic
- Handle Excel to JSON conversion, supporting multiple sheets

---

## 🔑 Step 3: Implement API Key Authentication
- Integrate authentication middleware
- Secure endpoints with API keys

---

## ✅ Step 4: Local Testing
- Run and test the FastAPI app locally
- Verify Excel multi-sheet conversion functionality
- Verify API key authentication

---

## 📁 Step 5: Version Control
- Initialize Git repository
- Push your application code to GitHub or GitLab

---

## ☁️ Step 6: Deploy on Render
- Connect repository to Render
- Configure deployment settings (runtime, build, start commands)
- Deploy the FastAPI application

---

## 🌐 Step 7: Verify Deployed Application
- Test deployed endpoints
- Ensure multi-sheet conversion and authentication are functional

---

## 🔄 Step 8: External Application Integration
- Document how external applications can securely interact with your API

---

## 🛡 Step 9: Practical Recommendations
- Review security practices
- Monitor and handle errors effectively
- Manage file size constraints within Render’s free-tier limitations
